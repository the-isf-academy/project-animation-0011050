# Teacher Comments

Amazing job with this animation, Julian! Your code demonstrates a fantastic grasp of topics covered this unit.

## Practices
### Planning 3/3
- Super detailed planning document with realistic test cases

### Iterative development 2/3
- Overall good job commiting to Github, however you commited under the amount of total in-class work days
- During project, at a minimum, be sure to commit to Github each class peroid.

### Testing 3/3
- Your project works immediately and your settings work as expected

### Readability 2/3
- Super detailed README.md file as well as easy to understand function and variable names
- As you noted in your self-assessment, your functions did not include comments

## Concepts
## Abstraction 3/3
- Great use of parameters and settings to change the size and color of the amogus. A great, easily achievable extension would have been a setting to change the color of both amogus charachters and the dead body. 
- Creative use `random()` function to randomize the location and size of the circles for the background
- A few lines in your `draw_dead()` function could have included a loop to reduce code redundancy

## Decomposition 3/3
- Great work your vision into smaller pieces
